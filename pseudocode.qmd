# The ratings of Doctor Who episodes by year

For the sake of simplicity, we want to take the air date of each episode and turn it into a new column called 'year' so we can plot accordingly. Extract the year of each Doctor Who episode by using the format function. This can also be done another way, but it's easier just by using format.

Use the function group_by on the years of the episodes so the average rating can be calculated. Use the summarize function to do this for each year.

Use ggplot to graph the average ratings by year. Make the graph look nice and pretty with labels and double encoding for readability.

Analyze the graph. What does it show? Has Doctor Who been getting better or worse over the years?

# The amount of viewers of each episode by season

The last thing we'll observe is the amount of viewers by season. We will have to deal with missing data here, as some episodes don't have a specific season, such as specials. However, each episode has an episode number, and we can lump together the episodes based on the time interval that each season has (season 1's time interval starts with episode 1 of season 1 and ends before episode 1 of season 2). Using the interval function, label each episode with a season number in a new column.

Using ggplot, make a line chart of each episode (x-axis is episode number, y-axis is number of viewers) and color the line/dot/section of the graph a different color by season. Give each special episode a unique color. Analyze the graph. What has the viewership been like over the seasons? Do specials get more or less views?

# The frequency of writer + director combo

Clean up the data while keeping it tidy. library(dyplr) is needed for data cleaning Using the merge function, combine the list of Doctor Who writers and directors with the episodes list, so each episode is matched with a writer and director. Address any issues with NA values and whatnot.

Using ggplot, make an appropriate graph showing the frequencies of directors, writers, and the combinations. To set something up for later, make another column called "combo" that is the combination of each director and writer. We will be working with strings a little bit using dyplir. Using the mutate and sub functions, remove the first names of every director and writer, and combine them with a hyphen, such as "Moffat-Haynes". For now, the graph can use the separate writer and director column.
